# Fraud Detection in E-Commerce Transactions: A DevOps Team's Approach to ML Integration

### Steps Taken

**Data Connection and Preprocessing:**
We established a robust foundation with our data through several key steps:

**Virtual Environmnet Creation:** All three of those proposed models require dependencies and packages to be installed that specifically enable us to use machine learning to analyze, manipulate and predict data. I strongly encourage you to create a virtual environment if you intend on also training and implementing any of these models - this will ensure that none of the packages will conflict with or otherwise effect any other software already installed on your terminals. After creating the venv, you can run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the requirements necessary to run the models (provided you've cloned this repo to your terminal already).

**Database Connection:** We began by establishing a secure connection to our SQLite database (db.sqlite3) using pandas, which provided a reliable and efficient way to access our data. From the account_stripemodel table, we extracted 3,002 initial transactions, giving us a substantial dataset to work with. We implemented careful validation procedures to ensure data integrity throughout the process.

**Feature Engineering:** Our approach to feature engineering focused on creating meaningful indicators of fraudulent activity. We extracted email domains to look for patterns in potentially suspicious sources, analyzed card usage frequency to identify unusual spending patterns, and created sophisticated location-based features to spot geographical anomalies. These engineered features significantly improved our model's ability to detect suspicious patterns.

```python

# Core feature engineering for fraud detection
def engineer_features(data):
    """
    Creates fraud-indicative features from raw transaction data
    """
    # Extract and analyze email patterns
    data['email_domain'] = data['email'].apply(lambda x: x.split('@')[1])
    data['email_domain_freq'] = data.groupby('email_domain')['id'].transform('count')
    
    # Track suspicious patterns
    data['card_usage_count'] = data.groupby('card_number')['id'].transform('count')
    data['multiple_states'] = data.groupby('customer_id')['address_state'].transform('nunique') > 1
    
    return data
```

**Data Preparation:** The preparation phase was crucial for ensuring our models would perform optimally. We standardized all location data to ensure consistency, developed frequency-based features to capture unusual patterns, implemented robust handling of missing values to maintain data integrity, and normalized all numerical features to ensure consistent model performance across different scales of data.

### Model Selection

**Comparative Analysis:**

Our thorough evaluation process involved implementing and testing three distinct approaches, each with its own strengths and challenges:

**Isolation Forest:** This model emerged as our champion due to its elegant approach to anomaly detection. It uses a tree-based isolation method that proved remarkably effective at identifying outliers in our transaction data. The model's efficiency at handling high-dimensional data was particularly impressive, identifying 30 anomalies (1%) in our training data and 32 anomalies (3%) in our test data - rates that align well with industry expectations for fraud detection.

```python
def create_isolation_forest(contamination=0.01):
    """
    Create and configure Isolation Forest model
    
    Parameters:
    contamination (float): Expected proportion of anomalies (default: 1%)
    
    The model works by isolating anomalies through random feature splitting,
    similar to playing a very efficient game of 20 questions.
    """
    model = IsolationForest(
        n_estimators=200,          # Number of trees in the forest
        contamination=contamination,# Expected percentage of anomalies
        max_samples='auto',        # Sample size for each tree
        random_state=42            # For reproducibility
    )
    return model
```

**DBSCAN:** While initially promising, this density-based clustering approach showed some limitations in practice. In our initial runs, it found only 2 anomalies, which seemed compelling at first - especially considering how suspcious the two fraudulent entries seemed - but was too conservative in practice. After optimization, the results varied dramatically - finding between 2 and 66 anomalies depending on the parameters used. This instability made it less reliable for our needs, despite its sophisticated mathematical foundation.

```python
def create_dbscan_model():
    """
    Configure DBSCAN clustering model
    
    This density-based approach looks for transactions that don't cluster
    well with others, like finding sparse areas in a crowded room.
    """
    model = DBSCAN(
        eps=0.5,           # Maximum distance between two samples
        min_samples=5,     # Minimum samples in a neighborhood
        n_jobs=-1          # Use all available processors
    )
    return model
```

**Autoencoder:** The Autoencoder model was my first attempt at optimizing a model for fradulent financial activity detection. This was due to familiariy - I was able to build a very similar CNN model using the ResNet base model to detect the presence of Pnuemonia in Xray scans, to very postive results. While I was able to get 91% prediciton accuracy for that model, Our attempts at building a neural network-based approach for this case was less compelling, with the highest F1-Score from the model being 81%. The model found 31 anomalies in the training data and 22 in the test data. However, the computational resources required and the complexity of maintaining this solution made it less practical for our specific use case, even though its accuracy was comparable to the Isolation Forest.

```python
def create_autoencoder(input_dim):
    """
    Build autoencoder neural network
    
    This model learns to reconstruct normal transactions and flags
    those it has trouble recreating as potential fraud.
    """
    input_layer = layers.Input(shape=(input_dim,))
    
    # Encoder - compress the transaction data
    encoded = layers.Dense(32, activation='relu', 
                         kernel_regularizer=tf.keras.regularizers.l2(0.01))(input_layer)
    encoded = layers.Dropout(0.2)(encoded)  # Prevent overfitting
    encoded = layers.Dense(16, activation='relu')(encoded)
    encoded = layers.Dense(8, activation='relu')(encoded)
    
    # Decoder - reconstruct the transaction data
    decoded = layers.Dense(16, activation='relu')(encoded)
    decoded = layers.Dense(32, activation='relu')(decoded)
    decoded = layers.Dense(input_dim, activation='sigmoid')(decoded)
    
    return Model(input_layer, decoded)
```

### Why Isolation Forest Won

The Isolation Forest model distinguished itself through several compelling advantages:

**Performance Metrics:** The model's performance was consistently impressive across our testing scenarios. It maintained a steady 1-3% fraud detection rate, which aligns perfectly with industry expectations. Perhaps most convincingly, it showed strong agreement with our Autoencoder model, confirming 20 out of 22 cases. This consistency across different datasets provided strong validation of its reliability.

**Practical Advantages:** From an implementation standpoint, the Isolation Forest proved to be a clear winner. Its lower computational complexity means we can process transactions faster and more efficiently. The model's architecture makes it easier to deploy and maintain, reducing the operational overhead. The results are more interpretable than complex neural networks, making it easier to explain why certain transactions were flagged. Additionally, it showed remarkable stability across different parameter settings, making it more robust in production.

**Implementation Benefits:** When it comes to real-world application, the Isolation Forest really shines. It can score transactions in real-time with minimal latency, easily scales to handle large transaction volumes as our platform grows, and provides clear explanations for why specific transactions were flagged as suspicious. These practical benefits make it an ideal choice for our production environment.

```python
# Training Data Results (3,002 transactions)
training_results = {
    'Isolation Forest': {'anomalies': 30, 'percentage': '1.0%'},
    'DBSCAN': {'anomalies': 22, 'percentage': '0.7%'},
    'Autoencoder': {'anomalies': 31, 'percentage': '1.0%'}
}

# Test Data Results (1,052 transactions)
test_results = {
    'Isolation Forest': {'anomalies': 32, 'percentage': '3.0%'},
    'DBSCAN': {'anomalies': 66, 'percentage': '6.3%'},
    'Autoencoder': {'anomalies': 22, 'percentage': '2.1%'}
}

overlap_analysis = {
    'Isolation Forest & Autoencoder': 20,  # Strong agreement
    'Isolation Forest & DBSCAN': 26,       # Moderate agreement
    'Autoencoder & DBSCAN': 20            # Moderate agreement
}
```

### Tuning and Testing

Optimization Process

We refined our approach through several carefully planned iterations:

**Parameter Optimization:** The tuning process was methodical and data-driven. We experimented with contamination rates ranging from 0.01 to 0.03 to find the sweet spot for fraud detection sensitivity. Multiple tests with estimator counts between 100 and 300 helped us optimize processing speed without sacrificing accuracy. We also validated different sample sizes (auto, 100, and 200) to ensure robust anomaly detection across varying transaction volumes.

**Feature Engineering Improvements:** Our focus on enhancing features paid off significantly. We introduced location-based pattern tracking that helped identify suspicious changes in transaction locations. The frequency analysis implementation gave us insights into unusual patterns in card usage. Most importantly, our customer behavior profiles helped establish normal patterns, making anomalies easier to detect.

**Validation Process:** We implemented a thorough validation strategy to ensure reliability. This included cross-validation on our training data to verify consistency, testing on a separate fraud dataset to confirm effectiveness, and detailed analysis of how different models agreed or disagreed on suspicious transactions. This comprehensive approach helped confirm the robustness of our solution.

## Results

**Performance Analysis**

**Training Dataset Performance:** Working with our initial 3,002 transactions, the results were highly encouraging. The model identified 30 anomalies, representing 1.0% of transactions - a rate that aligns perfectly with typical fraud patterns in e-commerce. What's particularly validating is how well these findings matched up with our other models, suggesting we're catching real patterns rather than false positives.

**Test Dataset Insights:** When we moved to our test dataset of 1,052 transactions, the model maintained its reliability. It flagged 32 transactions (3.0%) as potentially fraudulent, with 20 of these cases being independently confirmed by our Autoencoder model. The patterns it identified were clear and actionable, focusing on:

- Transactions spread across multiple states that raised red flags
- Suspicious patterns in email domain usage
- Unusual frequencies in card usage that stood out from normal behavior



**Model Effectiveness**

Our analysis revealed several key strengths in how the model performed:

**Pattern Recognition:** The model excelled at identifying key fraud indicators, specifically:

- Successfully spotted transactions that showed suspicious geographical dispersion
- Identified unusual patterns in how email domains were being used
- Caught irregular card usage patterns that deviated from normal customer behavior


**Consistency:** We saw remarkable consistency in the detection rates across different testing periods and transaction volumes. This stability is crucial for a production environment where false positives can be costly.

**Accuracy:** The low false positive rate was particularly impressive, meaning we're less likely to inconvenience legitimate customers while still catching suspicious activity.

### Integration into Application UI

**Implementation Strategy**

Our integration plan focuses on three key areas:

**Real-time Processing Capabilities:** The system we've developed offers immediate transaction scoring without adding significant processing overhead. Each transaction receives a clear risk level indicator, and our automated flagging system helps prioritize which transactions need review. The speed and accuracy here are crucial for maintaining a smooth customer experience while ensuring security.

**Enhanced Admin Dashboard:** We've designed the admin interface to make fraud detection intuitive and efficient. Key features include:

- A new risk score column that gives immediate visibility into transaction risk levels
- An intuitive color-coding system that helps quickly identify high-risk transactions
- Detailed views that provide the full context of flagged transactions
- Efficient batch processing capabilities for reviewing historical data


**Comprehensive Alert System:** Our alert mechanism is designed to keep fraud prevention proactive rather than reactive:

- Immediate notifications for high-risk transactions that need urgent attention
- Daily summary reports that help identify emerging patterns
- Customizable sensitivity controls that can be adjusted based on business needs

### Deployment Steps

**Model Deployment:** Our implementation plan prioritizes reliability and efficiency:

- Serializing the model for consistent behavior across all instances
- Creating robust API endpoints for seamless integration
- Setting up comprehensive monitoring systems


**UI Integration:** The user interface updates focus on usability:

- A dedicated fraud detection tab in the admin panel that centralizes all related functions
- Intuitive transaction risk detail views that make investigation straightforward
- A streamlined review workflow that increases efficiency


**Ongoing Maintenance:** We've established a robust monitoring framework:

- Regular tracking of model performance metrics
- Scheduled model retraining to maintain accuracy
- Systematic logging of false positives and negatives for continuous improvement

## Conclusion

Our implementation of the Isolation Forest model represents a significant step forward in fraud detection capabilities. It strikes an ideal balance between accuracy, efficiency, and maintainability - three crucial factors for any production system. The model's consistent performance across different datasets, combined with its practical advantages in implementation, makes it the perfect choice for our needs.

The real strength of this solution lies in its simplicity - while the underlying mathematics may be complex, the day-to-day operation and maintenance are straightforward. This means we can focus on what matters most - protecting our platform from fraud while ensuring a smooth experience for legitimate users.

As we move forward, this system provides a solid foundation that can grow and adapt with our platform's needs, ensuring we stay one step ahead in the ongoing challenge of fraud prevention.
